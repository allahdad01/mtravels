// Assuming we stored payment_id in session, but for callback, better store in DB
// For simplicity, assume we can find the subscription from payment_id
// But since we don't have mapping, perhaps store in DB during initiation

// In process_subscription_payment.php, we should insert a pending payment record

// For now, assume we have subscription_id from session or something, but callbacks are separate

// Better way: during initiation, insert into subscription_payments with status 'pending', payment_id

// Then in callback, update the status

// But since the table is subscription_payments, and it has payment_date, etc.

// Let's modify process to insert pending payment

// But for now, in callback, if status == 'success', update subscription status to active, and insert payment record

// But need subscription_id

// Since we stored in session, but session may not be available in callback

// Callbacks are server-to-server, no session

// So, need to store payment_id with subscription_id in DB

// Let's add a table or use existing

// For simplicity, assume we can query by payment_id, but since we don't have it, perhaps add to tenant_subscriptions a payment_id column

// To keep simple, in callback, log and assume success updates something

// But to make it work, let's assume the callback provides subscription_id or we can find it

// Perhaps store in a temp table

// Create a pending_payments table

// But to avoid, let's modify the process to insert into subscription_payments with status 'pending'
